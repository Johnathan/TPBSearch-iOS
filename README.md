# TPB Search

A React Native app (iOS Only for now) for not searching TPB and definitely not for adding downloads to a queue on a server somewhere that your computer can’t monitor for new not torrents to not download.

### #todo
- Add settings tab
	- Add configurable URL for tpb
	- Add configurable URL for queue server (some authentication would be good as well)
- Deal with errors from tpb (sometimes it just doesn’t connect to the database and you have to keep hitting search until it works)
